structureJS
===========

With structureJS you are able to keep the structure of your Javascript app logically and physically separated into files, modules, and groups. You are able to view and change that structure from a single manifest file. Yet when it's time to deploy your app, you are able to deploy your app as a single, compressed file. structureJS is smart enough to remove parts of itself not necessary in deployment resulting in a tiny 3kB footprint. 

It is designed specificallty to fit in with your existing stack and will not get in the way of any other Javascript tools or frameworks in your developement stack (AngularJS for exaple). Once you use strucreJS to organize and modularize your projects, you will never go back to the old way.
