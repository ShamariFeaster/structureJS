structureJS
===========

With structureJS you are able to keep the structure of your Javascript app logically and physically separated into files, modules, and groups. You are able to view and change that structure from a single manifest file. Yet when it's time to deploy your app, you are able to deploy your app as a single, compressed file. structureJS is smart enough to remove parts of itself not necessary in deployment resulting in a tiny 3kB footprint. 

It is designed specificallty to fit in with your existing stack and will not get in the way of any other Javascript tools or frameworks in your developement stack (AngularJS for exaple). Once you use strucreJS to organize and modularize your projects, you will never go back to the old way.

Use structureJS to:

1. Keep your app broken up into several files, modules, or groups
2. Automatic dependency ordering and resolution
2. Compatible with frameworks such as AngularJS
3. 3kB deployment size
2. Create reusable, configurable modules.
3. Share your modules or use other people's over the Internet - no downloading required
4. View & modify the structure of your app from a single manifest file
5. Minify and combine modules, files, or entire project into a single file using only your browser. Deploy in seconds not minutes
5. Utilize module dependencies easily
6. Only puts one variable into the global namespace
7. Partially AMD compliant (works with jQuery AMD for now, more to come)
8. Logically group files and modules, export those groups to combined, compressed files 
9. Automatic global dependency checking
