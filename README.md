structureJS
===========

structureJS is a Javascript developent tool written in Javascript. It is a module creator and loader file and/or module loader. It synchronizes file/module importation. It contains a tool called the Project Manager Interface (PMI) that lets you minify and combine your entire project using only your browser.

It can do much more but listing it here would be terrible. I know, I tried.

It is designed specificallty to fit in with your existing stack and will not get in the way of any other Javascript tools or frameworks in your developement stack (AngularJS for exaple). Once you use strucreJS to organize and modularize your projects, you will never go back to the old way.

OK, maybe I should say a bit more about structureJS here:

1. Keep your app broken up into several files, modules, or groups
2. Automatic dependency ordering and resolution
2. Compatible with frameworks such as AngularJS
3. 3kB deployment size
2. Create reusable, configurable modules.
3. Share your modules or use other people's over the Internet - no downloading required
4. View & modify the structure of your app from a single manifest file
5. Minify and combine modules, files, or entire project into a single file using only your browser. Deploy in seconds not minutes
5. Utilize module dependencies easily
6. Only puts one variable into the global namespace
7. Partially AMD compliant (works with jQuery AMD for now, more to come)
8. Logically group files and modules, export those groups to combined, compressed files 
9. Automatic global dependency checking
